# Introduction

Software Engineer is long journey where one of us need to learn and work so hard
to pursue. I'm not a person with good memory, working with variety of languages
sometimes confused me with their syntax.

So I decided to create my own tech book to note down and summarize all knowledge
that I get over the years.
